## A platformer with a flip

This project is a 2D platformer originally designed for Case Western Reserve University's eecs290 Inro to Game Design class. It is a 2D sidescroller platformer where the player can interact with either the top or bottom of the world, by process of the main game mechanic: the _flip_.

The game has mostly basic platformer mechanics. The player jumps from platform to platform, going from left to right in an attempt to reach the goal. The platforms can be stationary or moving between two points. The only hazard is missing a platform and falling into a bottomless pit (There are checkpoints that save you from having to start a level all over).

The mechanic that makes this game unique is the ability for the player to flip the world, making the ceiling of the world become the floor and vice versa. This allows for the player to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles, though it introduces challenges of its own. The game player is forced to think more abstractly about the surface they are running on, and determine how to pass challenges using both the top and the bottom of the world to move ahead.

The game aims to be a puzzle platformer, using the spatial fuzziness of objects since they may only exist on one side of the map. The game is single player, since there is no good way to share the world-flipping mechanic. There are no enemies in the world, but there are bottomless pits and other environmental hazards that the player can encounter, forcing the player to start the level (or possibly the game) over. Some of the platforms are moving, and some of them aren't affected by the world flipping as well, adding to the types of puzzles alloted.
