Refining:
---------

- Can flip world to interact with top of world
- Ghosting character for reference on top
- Can fall and die
    - Checkpoints for saving progress
    - Maybe add lives?
- Humanoid protagonist
    - Move Jump Flip
- Simple design (retro)
    - Simple foreground, more detailed background
- Platforms
    - Static
    - Elevators?
    - Flip-invulnerable platforms?
    - Flip-effected platforms (falling)?
